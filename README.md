AndroBada525
============

Android inspired custom ROMs for the Samsung Wave 525 built by The Team K Developers in 2012 and 2013 (special thanks to The X Team Developers whose work we used as a base). I cannot imagine anyone using that phone in 2019 but since some people are and requested for the sources, here you go. Switch between branches for the source code of various releases. v2.0 is the latest release. 

And we did have a YouTube channel back then, lol: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIVldZFiC0Ktf3FmWNtpzMA

Refer to the channel for videos showing screenshots of the various releases
